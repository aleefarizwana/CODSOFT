    <h2>PERSONAL PROJECTS</h2>
    <section id="projects">
        <h4>1. host web application on cloud</h4>
        <p>This Project is meant for IT Managers and System Architects who want to understand how to run
            traditional web architectures in the cloud to achieve elasticity, scalability, and reliability.
            I created a simple serverless web application that enables users to request unicorn rides from the Wild Rydes fleet. 
            The application will present users with an HTML-based user interface for indicating the location where they would like to be picked up and will interact with a RESTful web service on the backend to submit the request and dispatch a nearby unicorn. 
            The application will also provide facilities for users to register with the service and log in before requesting rides.
        </p>
        <h4>2.Portfolio</h4>
        <p> Developed a JavaScript-based interactive portfolio showcasing my work.
            A portfolio completely reflects a person .
            Hence i designed my own portfolio with various sections describing my skills,experience,projects as well as a link to my resume.
            My portfolio starts with a header including my name,image of myself,a brief intro or a tagline then we can include multiple sections
            and a footer section is at the end of the page having any copy right notice or any additional links.
        </p>
        <h4>3.Spring Boot based User Registration</h4>
        <p>Spring Boot is a framework that is part of Java <b>SPRING</b> Technology.
            By using predefined modules and dependencies available in Spring ,i developed a user registration form to enter his/her data and then store in MYSQL database.
            My project overcomes the drawbacks from traditional architectures.</p>
